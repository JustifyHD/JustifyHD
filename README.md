Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹, my name is Justify, or you can call me John. I graduated last December with a Computer Science degree and have been in the software development workforce
for about 3 years with exposure to languages such as C#, Java, Python, C++, SQL, Genero, and many more to learn along the journey. I'm always strving to learn new things and
to collaborate with others on different open source projects. Feel free to test my coding projects as soon as I get them uploaded on GitHub :)
